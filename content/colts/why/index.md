While discussing the COLTS proposal with some friends, the topic of mod players asking for mod ports came up. Personally, I believe it's primarily a simple issue of mod players not being aware of how Mojang versioning works, so let this be a simple explanation.
 
## Why?
The main reason is that mojang likes breaking things, often.
 
Imagine a mod as a sand castle, Normally, if you were to leave a sand castle unattended, over time the wind or tides would wear away at your sandcastle until it's just a pile of sand. In a typical project, you either get the wind or the tides, the thing you are modding updates often, but the changes are generally small and manageable enough that fixing your sandcastle isn't an issue, and could even be partially automated. Other projects might be closer to the tides, where there thing you are modding has updates with big breaking changes, but these updates are infrequent enough that keeping up isn't that bad. Sure, you have to replace a big hole in your castle all at once, but you only have to do this once every couple of years, and the new material can make your castle even better.
 
Mojang does both, at the same time. Rapid, breaking updates that are a massive pain to keep up with. This was already an issue before now, and has only become expolentally worse with game drops becoming the primary way to deliver content.

Now that doesn't nessisarly mean that the changes mojang makes are bad, some of them can be good for developement, but that doesn't change the fact most people simply dont have the time to be constantly repairing their sand castles, hence why mod developers tend to update sporatically. 

If you would like some more detailed reading, take a look at [this](https://notes.highlysuspect.agency/blog/the_treadmill/), and ponder at how it's somehow gotten worse since it was written.

## What to do?
In terms of porting the mods, not much can be done. Some form of wrapper to allow mods to run on multiple versions isn't a viable option.

Now backporting future content, on the other hand, [is already a thing](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vanillabackport). 

That combined with some kind of recurring vote for a Community LTS version so that mod devlopers can communicate with each other on what versions to settle on, would be the simpliest option. and would allow you to play with both your favorite mods, and the new vanilla content. So, instead of begging mod devlopers to port their mods to a version the second it comes out, consider asking them about COLTS instead. Just make sure that no one else has already asked, of course.
