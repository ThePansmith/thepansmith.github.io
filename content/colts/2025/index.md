## Discussion and following 
If you would like to discuss the vote, or be notified of future votes, a discord has been created [here](https://discord.gg/34KNtwBZ56). If discord isn't your thing, this blog has a [RSS feed](https://thepansmith.github.io/index.xml) that you can follow.

A followup post will go out detailing the results of this, so be sure to share this with fellow developers and players so more precise data can be gathered!

### Why Independent?
After some conversation, it was decided that it would be best if the vote was hosted independently, rather than being a part of any existing entity. 

## Feedback
Some previous readers might notice that the proposal has tweaked a bit, thanks to feedback. Notably, a decent number of users misinterpreted the usage of verification, and assumed that the proposal was about creating essentially a Minecraft HOA consisting of only "notible" mod developers. Given social media's usage of the adjective ("verified checkmark", etc) this was an understandable misinterpretation to make, and a definition I didn't consider when writing about antispam/impersonation. Given that a cabal is something I am expressively avoiding, such cases have been rewritten.

Beyond that, some other things have been tweaked to be more clear, the feedback is greatly appreciated!

## Miscellaneous

Ended up also writing a short article on mod porting issues, to be linked to people asking why a mod hasn't been ported.
