## Timing
A followup post will go out detailing the results of this, so be sure to share this with fellow developers and players so better data can be made. Voting will end on the tenth of September. 

Voting for this cycle will end on the tenth of September. Come next year, a more "typical" time for voting will be picked, but it would be better that the concept is introduced now, rather than waiting an additional three months at minimum (even if it means that this cycle might become somewhat short).

## Discussion and following 
If you would like to discuss the vote, or be notified of future votes, a discord has been created [here](https://discord.gg/34KNtwBZ56). If discord isn't your thing, this blog has a [RSS feed](https://thepansmith.github.io/index.xml) that you can follow.

### Why Independent?
After some conversation, it was decided that it would be best if the vote was hosted independently, rather than being a part of any existing entity, such as Curseforge or Modrinth. Being independent also means that more time can be invested into it by the hosts of the vote, rather than it being something on top of the large pile of tasks that already need to be managed.

### Proposal Feedback
Some previous readers might notice that the proposal has been tweaked a bit, thanks to feedback. Notably, a decent number of users misinterpreted the usage of verification, and assumed that the proposal was about creating essentially a Minecraft Homeowner's Association consisting of only "notible" mod developers. Given social media's usage of the adjective ("verified checkmark", etc) this was an understandable misinterpretation to make, and a definition I didn't consider when writing about antispam/impersonation. Given that a cabal is something I am expressively avoiding, such cases have been rewritten.

Beyond that, some other things have been tweaked to be more clear, the feedback has been greatly appreciated!

## Miscellaneous

I also ended up writing a short article on mod porting, to be linked to people asking why a mod hasn't been ported. Like mentioned in the proposal itself, I believe that a lot of the people asking for mod ports constantly simply are just not aware of the time and energy investment, and would understand once properly taught.
